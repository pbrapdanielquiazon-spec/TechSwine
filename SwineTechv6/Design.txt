Got it 👍 You already have good foundations (sidebar + dashboard + cards + modals).
Now, when we talk about designing it, we’re moving beyond just code into UI/UX strategy. Let me guide you step by step, specific to your SwineTech system:

🎨 1. Choose a Consistent Color Palette

You already liked the Minimal Neutral UI:

Primary (Sidebar/Headers): --color-primary: #2E3B4E (Dark Slate → modern, professional)

Accent (Add/Save): --color-accent-green: #43A047 (Fresh Green → positive actions)

Accent (View/Edit): --color-accent-blue: #29B6F6 (Sky Blue → neutral action)

Danger (Delete/Archive): #E53935 (Red → destructive action)

Background: --color-bg: #f5f6f8 (light, clean background)

Cards/Boxes: White with shadows

👉 Rule: One dark base, one positive green, one neutral blue, one alert red.

🖥 2. Layout Structure

Your system has two main views:

Admin/Staff: Needs data-heavy design (tables, forms, reports).

Clients: Needs friendly shopping-like design (cards, product images).

✅ Keep sidebar fixed left across both → avoids confusion when switching roles.
✅ Top area (dashboard header) → show page title + actions.
✅ Content area → tables for admin, product cards for clients.

🗂 3. Component Styles

Here’s how each piece should be designed:

Sidebar

Dark background (var(--color-primary))

White text + green hover (var(--color-accent-green))

Icons (FontAwesome) for clarity

Cards

Rounded (border-radius: 12px)

Drop shadow for depth

Use icons + numbers (e.g., 🐖 "Total Pigs: 120")

Tables

Zebra striping (alternate row background) → easier to scan

Hover highlight (background: #f0f4f7)

Action buttons aligned right (Edit | Archive)

Modals

Centered, soft shadow

Clear Save/Cancel buttons with consistent colors:

Green = Save

Red = Delete

Gray = Cancel

📱 4. Client vs. Admin Styling

Client View → lighter, more welcoming

White sidebar background

Cards with pig images, prices, “Book Now” button

Minimal text, large clickable buttons

Admin View → functional

Dark sidebar background

Focus on data tables, filters, reports

Icons + tooltips to reduce clutter

🔑 5. UX Rules

Consistency: Same button style for same action (don’t use red for save).

Hierarchy: Titles bigger → section headers → table text.

Feedback: Show confirmation after actions (“✅ Supply recorded”).

Accessibility: Minimum 16px font, high contrast text on buttons.

✅ If you follow this, your system will look professional, consistent, and easy to use.
If you’d like, I can mock up one page (Admin Dashboard + Client Dashboard) in full HTML+CSS so you see the before & after.

👉 Do you want me to start with the Admin Dashboard (data-heavy) or the Client Dashboard (friendly cards)?
