ðŸ”¹ Making it Reusable for All Roles

Admin â†’ Full profile + email + picture + password change.

Staff (Sales/Procurement/Caretaker) â†’ Same as admin, but role is fixed (not editable).

Client â†’ Only name, email, password, picture.

ðŸ‘‰ Use backend logic to control what fields load:

<?php if($_SESSION['role'] == 'admin') { ?>
  <!-- show extra fields -->
<?php } ?>
